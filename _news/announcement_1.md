This service is a Decentralized Apps-related platform integrated with LINE, and I'm involved in its promotion. In just a week, the number of active users surpassed 100,000, and in two weeks, the number of paying users exceeded 150,000. As a promotion reward, we distributed KAIA tokens, and I participated in developing the token claim process. I'm thrilled that the service is doing so well!
